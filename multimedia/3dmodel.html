																	<p>I wanted to replace room D207’s stairs with wheelchair accessible ramps. 
																		This nullifies the bad personal experience of tripping on the short stairs.  Also, to make the room feel spacious, I planned to add as many windows as possible. 
																		The decision to keep the terrace design of the classroom was because lecturer was more visible to the students, and the computers did not obscure their line of site.

																<p>The color of the classroom floor remained unchanged. Also, the determination to go with the wooden walls was its popularity with current lecture theatres. 
																	Also wood has more sound dampening to reduce the annoying sound echo. I went with round tables to further increase viewing angle as well as reduce the chances of computers blocking student’s sight of the lecturer. Also, curved tables give the classrooms a more futuristic feel. 
																	However, the reason for not adhering to the overall curved theme with the wall tables because students sitting near the wall will be at an awkward angle to the lecturer.
																	 nevertheless , I did make their edges curved to avoid sharp incidences.  Also, I took inspiration from airplanes by having row table’s diagonal to the wall. This ensures the all the students sitting on the wall are facing the lecturer. 
																	Furthermore, I made sure the aisles were large enough to comfortability fit Wheelchair-bound students.

																		<p>Creating the terrace floors, was perhaps the most challenging and tedious part of the assignment. 
																			This was done by copying a series of rectangles with the dimensions that match the material components. 
																			This saved a lot of time rather than creating separate rectangles and making their sizes identical. 
																			To create the ramps, the shortcut was to tether the rectangles to the floor plane by grouping them.
																			 Using the scaling tool, elongating the X dimensions of the floor and wall will, in turn, stretch the varying heights edges of the rectangles and transform the height difference into ramps.
																		<br>
																		<br>	
																		The tables were made by using the circle tool. They consisted of an outer circle and an inner circle. 
																		The inner circle was achieved by using the offset tool that would measure from the edges of the plane of the outer circle. 
																		After adjusting the height of the table to match the height of the ruler using the push/pull tool I used the arc tool to slice the circles to give the tables the arched look. 
																		Then I made the tables hollow by deleting segments using the line tool. However, sometimes the inner side of the tables will appear polygonous, and this is remedied by masking or antialiasing the edges of the walls appear smooth. 
																		The side tables consisted of rectangles treated in much the same way. The challenge was to level the individual tables on the varying floor levels, while at the same time aligning  (with the aid of the ruler tool) them to be at the exactly facing the opposite tables.
																		 Bundling the separate tables into groups allows to position the tables at equal distances apart all at the same time. Then I needed to edit the individual components (tables of the group) so they are in level with the floor.  The speakers, and the TV all needed their rotation to be adjusted to be facing diagonally using the rotation tool.  
																		 Also for realism rather than having the models float in the air, beams made of rectangles were attached them to the wall. 
																		The models such as the computers, and the wheelchair, needed to be rotated to sit uniformly on the tables.
																		<br>
																		<br>
																		Much research and brute force were required to make the window models see through. 
																		Unfortunately, in order for the transparent material to show the inside of the room, it has to penetrate a double layered wall, or a wall thick enough to allow for the pull tool work. 
																		Followed by success, the outer wall was stripped to reveal the classroom wall.
